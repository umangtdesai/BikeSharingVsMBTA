# Effects of bike-sharing systems on the subway in Boston

With the rise in the sharing economy, companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft have been a
popular choice for many in the hospitality and transportation industry. Another company that
works under the same, ‘fee-based’ sharing model is Bluebikes.

As a team, we wondered on what factors play into this decision on taking the T vs.
choosing to ride a bike. At what threshold do we have the switch between biking and riding the
T. Is it merely the fact the Bluebikes are more accessible or the weather is bad or there are other
features at play?

More specifically, is Bluebikes a substitute or a compliment to the MBTA? If it is, what
factors determine the substitution or complementary effect and what thresholds need to be met to
make this switch?
